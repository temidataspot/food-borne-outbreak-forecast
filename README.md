### **Foodborne Outbreak Forecasting Model**  
This repository contains an **R-based machine learning model** for predicting high-risk foods associated with foodborne illness outbreaks. The model leverages historical outbreak data to forecast potential risks and severity.  

#### **Project Features**  
✅ **Data Processing** – Cleans and structures outbreak data for analysis.  
✅ **ML Model** – Uses embeddings to represent food items and predict outbreak severity.  
✅ **Forecasting** – Generates predictions for future months based on trends.  

#### **Files in This Repository**  
- `food_outbreaks_script.R` – The main R script for data processing and modeling.  
- `outbreaks.xlsx` – The dataset used for training and prediction.  

#### **Usage**  
Run the `food_outbreaks_script.R` in RStudio to preprocess data, train the model, and generate forecasts.  
Run the `App.R` after installing the Shiny package to check predictions
